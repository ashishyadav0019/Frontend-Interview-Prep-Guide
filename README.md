# Frontend Interview Prep Guide (2-Week Plan)

This folder is a structured frontend interview preparation guide with three tracks:
- [triviaquestion.md](./triviaquestion.md) for fast concept recall
- [pragmaticUI.md](./pragmaticUI.md) for implementation-heavy coding rounds
- [systemdesign.md](./systemdesign.md) for architecture and senior-level discussions

## Target Roles

This guide is designed for:
- Frontend Developer (Junior to Mid)
- Frontend Engineer (Mid to Senior)
- Senior Frontend Engineer
- Lead Frontend Engineer / Frontend Architect
- UI Engineer / Design Systems Engineer
- React Engineer
- Full-Stack Engineer in frontend-focused interview loops

## How To Use The 3 Tracks

- [triviaquestion.md](./triviaquestion.md): strengthen fundamentals and interview articulation (JS, React, browser, accessibility, testing).
- [pragmaticUI.md](./pragmaticUI.md): practice building components with real constraints (state, UX behavior, accessibility, edge cases).
- [systemdesign.md](./systemdesign.md): develop system-level reasoning (requirements, data flow, performance, tradeoffs, scalability).

## 2-Week Preparation Plan

Time per day: 90 to 150 minutes

### Week 1: Fundamentals + Implementation Base

1. Day 1: 8 trivia topics + 1 easy pragmatic problem
2. Day 2: 8 trivia topics + 1 medium pragmatic problem
3. Day 3: 6 trivia topics + 1 medium pragmatic problem + solution review
4. Day 4: 8 trivia topics + 1 easy-to-medium pragmatic problem
5. Day 5: 6 trivia topics + 1 medium pragmatic problem + accessibility checklist
6. Day 6: 1 timed pragmatic problem (45 minutes) + postmortem notes
7. Day 7: Week review: revisit weak trivia topics and re-solve 1 earlier pragmatic problem without notes

### Week 2: Design + Simulation

1. Day 8: 2 system design topics + 4 trivia topics
2. Day 9: 2 system design topics + 1 medium/hard pragmatic problem
3. Day 10: 2 system design topics + 4 trivia topics
4. Day 11: 1 full mock coding round using a pragmatic problem (timed)
5. Day 12: 2 system design topics + design tradeoff summary notes
6. Day 13: 1 mixed mock session: 3 trivia + 1 pragmatic + 1 design discussion
7. Day 14: Final consolidation: revise mistakes, build quick notes, and prepare interview-ready answers

## Daily Session Template

1. Warm-up (15 min): 3 trivia topics
2. Core (45 to 75 min): 1 pragmatic problem or 1 system design topic
3. Wrap-up (15 min): write key learnings, edge cases, and tradeoffs

## What Good Progress Looks Like

By the end of 2 weeks, you should be able to:
- Explain core frontend concepts clearly without rambling
- Build medium-complexity UI components under time pressure
- Discuss architecture decisions with tradeoffs and scalability in mind
- Handle accessibility and performance considerations proactively

## Practical Tips For GitHub Reading

- Use the table of contents in each file to jump directly to topics.
- Work in small batches (3 to 5 items) and summarize in your own words.
- For pragmatic problems, always do one timed attempt before reading any reference notes.
- Track mistakes in a single “weak areas” list and revisit every 3 days.
