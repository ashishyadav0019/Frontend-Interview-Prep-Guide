# Frontend Interview Prep Guide

This folder is a practical prep kit for frontend interviews.  
It is designed to help you move from concept recall to coding execution to system design discussion.

## Start Here

If your next round is:
- Screening/fundamentals: begin with [triviaQuestion.md](./triviaQuestion.md)
- Live coding/take-home: begin with [pragmaticUI.md](./pragmaticUI.md)
- Architecture/system design: begin with [systemDesign.md](./systemDesign.md)
- Stage-2 depth upgrade: use [frontend-stage2-prep-playbook.md](./frontend-stage2-prep-playbook.md)

## Learning Tracks

| Track | What You Practice | Typical Topics | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Trivia Questions](./triviaQuestion.md) | Fast recall + clean explanations | Event loop, closures, React lifecycle/hooks, CORS, rendering, accessibility | Recruiter screens and short technical rounds |
| [Pragmatic UI Problems](./pragmaticUI.md) | Building correct UI behavior under constraints | Search/autocomplete, OTP, progress bar, data table, timers, debouncing, DOM tasks | Live coding and take-home assignments |
| [System Design](./systemDesign.md) | Structured architecture and tradeoff thinking | Caching, SSR/CSR, API design, scaling patterns, performance, reliability | Senior/lead frontend design rounds |
| [Stage-2 Playbook](./frontend-stage2-prep-playbook.md) | Deep interview narratives and gap closure | Web fundamentals, testing maturity, architecture operations, performance stories | Mid-to-senior loops |
| [Video Resources](./stage2-youtube-resources.md) | Guided revision with practical walkthroughs | System design, Core Web Vitals, React optimization, mock interview style | Supplementary prep |

## Expected Outcomes

After completing this guide, you should be able to:
- Explain frontend fundamentals with clear examples (not definitions only)
- Solve medium-complexity UI problems within interview time
- Discuss architecture choices with tradeoffs and constraints
- Present performance/debug stories with measurable impact

## 2-Week Execution Plan

Suggested daily effort: 90 to 150 minutes

### Week 1: Fundamentals + Coding Speed

- Day 1: 8 trivia topics + 1 easy pragmatic problem
- Day 2: 8 trivia topics + 1 medium pragmatic problem
- Day 3: 6 trivia topics + 1 medium problem + review
- Day 4: 8 trivia topics + 1 easy/medium problem
- Day 5: 6 trivia topics + 1 medium problem + accessibility checklist
- Day 6: 1 timed pragmatic problem (45 minutes) + postmortem notes
- Day 7: Revisit weak topics + re-solve 1 earlier problem without notes

### Week 2: Architecture + Mock Rounds

- Day 8: 2 system design topics + 4 trivia topics
- Day 9: 2 system design topics + 1 medium/hard pragmatic problem
- Day 10: 2 system design topics + 4 trivia topics
- Day 11: 1 full timed mock coding round
- Day 12: 2 system design topics + tradeoff notes
- Day 13: 1 mixed mock session (trivia + coding + design)
- Day 14: Final consolidation and interview answer prep

## Session Template (Use Daily)

1. Warm-up (15 min): 3 trivia topics
2. Core (45 to 75 min): 1 pragmatic problem or 1 system design topic
3. Review (15 min): write edge cases, tradeoffs, and what failed

## Role Fit

This prep stack is useful for:
- Frontend Developer (Junior to Mid)
- Frontend Engineer (Mid to Senior)
- Senior Frontend Engineer
- Lead Frontend Engineer / Frontend Architect
- UI Engineer / Design Systems Engineer
- React Engineer
- Full-Stack Engineer (frontend-heavy loops)
