# Frontend Interview Content Hub

This directory is a curated frontend preparation library.  
It combines concept depth, interview-style recall, and hands-on problem solving so you can move from knowledge to execution.

## Catalog

| Track | GitHub Catalog | Focus | Best For | Items |
|---|---|---|---|---:|
| Frontend System Design | [systemdesign.md](./systemdesign.md) | Architecture, tradeoffs, scalability, performance, API/data modeling | Senior interviews, architecture rounds, discussion-heavy panels | 35 |
| Frontend Trivia Questions | [triviaquestion.md](./triviaquestion.md) | Fast conceptual revision across JS, React, browser behavior, accessibility, testing | Screening rounds, quick revision, confidence building | 65 |
| Pragmatic UI Problems | [pragmaticUI.md](./pragmaticUI.md) | Practical UI challenges with state, UX behavior, accessibility, edge cases | Live coding rounds, take-home prep, implementation practice | 100 |

## Start Here

- Open [triviaquestion.md](./triviaquestion.md) first if you are restarting prep after a break.
- Open [systemdesign.md](./systemdesign.md) first if you are preparing for senior/staff interviews.
- Open [pragmaticUI.md](./pragmaticUI.md) first if your immediate goal is coding round practice.

## What Each Track Delivers

- [systemdesign.md](./systemdesign.md): Deep dives into real product-style frontend system design scenarios and structured breakdowns of requirements, architecture, state/data flow, and optimization decisions.
- [triviaquestion.md](./triviaquestion.md): High-frequency interview concepts in compact format so you can quickly test recall and identify weak fundamentals.
- [pragmaticUI.md](./pragmaticUI.md): Real implementation-style prompts that force practical decisions around interaction design, correctness, and accessibility.

## Recommended Learning Paths

### 1. Fast 7-Day Refresh

1. Day 1-2: Read 20-25 items from [triviaquestion.md](./triviaquestion.md).
2. Day 3-4: Read 8-10 items from [systemdesign.md](./systemdesign.md).
3. Day 5-7: Solve 10-15 items from [pragmaticUI.md](./pragmaticUI.md).

### 2. Balanced 2-Week Preparation

1. Daily: 5 trivia questions from [triviaquestion.md](./triviaquestion.md).
2. Alternate days: 1 system design topic from [systemdesign.md](./systemdesign.md).
3. Daily: 1 pragmatic implementation problem from [pragmaticUI.md](./pragmaticUI.md).
4. End of each week: revisit mistakes and re-solve without notes.

### 3. Interview-Heavy Month Plan

1. Week 1: Fundamentals and recall using [triviaquestion.md](./triviaquestion.md).
2. Week 2: Architecture and tradeoffs using [systemdesign.md](./systemdesign.md).
3. Week 3: Implementation intensity using [pragmaticUI.md](./pragmaticUI.md).
4. Week 4: Mixed simulation: one trivia topic, one design topic, one pragmatic problem per session.

## How To Use The Markdown Catalogs Efficiently

- Use the table of contents at the top of each file for direct topic jumps.
- Study in focused batches of 3 to 5 entries, then pause and summarize.
- Convert each topic into one short interview answer in your own words.
- For pragmatic problems, time-box first attempts to 35 to 45 minutes.
- After each session, track one thing you understood and one thing you need to revisit.

## Suggested Session Format

1. Warm-up: 2 trivia items.
2. Core: 1 system design item or 1 pragmatic problem.
3. Reflection: write 3 bullets on tradeoffs, edge cases, and accessibility.
4. Repeat: reattempt one previously solved item without looking at earlier notes.

## Who This Is For

- Frontend engineers preparing for product-company interviews.
- Developers moving from mid-level to senior/frontend lead expectations.
- Engineers who want both conceptual clarity and implementation readiness.

## Target Roles

This guide is suitable for interview prep across the following roles:

- Frontend Developer (Junior to Mid)
- Frontend Engineer (Mid to Senior)
- Senior Frontend Engineer
- Lead Frontend Engineer / Frontend Architect
- UI Engineer / Design Systems Engineer
- React Engineer (component-heavy product teams)
- Full-Stack Engineer targeting frontend-heavy interview loops

### Track To Role Fit

- `triviaquestion.md`: best for Junior/Mid screening rounds and fundamentals validation.
- `pragmaticUI.md`: best for Mid/Senior implementation rounds, live coding, and take-homes.
- `systemdesign.md`: best for Senior/Lead architecture discussions and system design interviews.

## Reading Notes

- Content includes rich HTML snippets rendered directly in Markdown files for GitHub readability.
- Topics are intentionally mixed across fundamentals, systems thinking, and practical UI execution.
- If you are short on time, prioritize consistency over volume.
